## Kymographs {#kymographs}

Kymographs are a way to represent a dynamic process as a single image. They are particularly useful to monitor and characterize the movement of a cell or organelle. They can be seen as an _x-t_ scan, where the intensity along a given line is plotted for all images of a stack. Each time point gives an intensity line, plotted _e.g._ along the x axis of the kymograph. These lines are stacked along the y axis for all frames. So we get an image where we move through space in the x direction and time in the y direction.

Open _**Kymograph.tif**_** **and draw a line across one of the cells that stay in the same area for the whole time series.

Go to Image&gt;Stacks&gt;Reslice and press ‘Ok’.

The resulting image displays space on the x-axis, an intensity profile across the cells in brightfield and fluorescence. Time is displayed on the y-axis \(top: start, bottom: end\), you can see the green fluorescence intensity increase over time and the cell move left and right in the brightfield image.
